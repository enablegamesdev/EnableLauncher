## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction
Enable Launcher is where you can access all games from EnableGames using your EnableGames account.

It can also handle body tracking using Kinect, Orbbec Astra, webcam, color tracking, or passing tracking data from EnableServer.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation
You can download the installer from the [release page](https://github.com/enablegamesdev/EnableLauncher/releases).

After installing the Launcher, log in using your enAbleGames account.  It may take a few minutes to check for updates.  When the Launcher asks if you would like to download updates, select "Yes".  The Launcher will open the Patcher application in a new window.

After the Patcher is finished, the Launcher will re-open.  Log in again when you see the login screen, and you will see the Library page.

Select the game you want to download from the left side of the screen.  Click the "Update Game" button in the top-left corner of the screen.  It will launch the Patcher in another window.
